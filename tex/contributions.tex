Due to the large volume of coding in this project, the authors worked separately to develop moths of the classes and methods. Andrew wrote most of the functionality of the Tree, including the crossover, mutate, evaluation, and calculation of fitness methods. He also wrote functions to read the supplied data into a usable format.  Michael completed the basic implementation of the Tree that Andrew began, as well as the underlying Node class. Michael wrote the driver program to create new generations, move through generations, as well as the tournament selection method. Each partner researched the parts of the program the implemented.
